I am Just a Regular guy learning to code and do cool things with electrons. I started a few years back messing around with Arduino Microcrontrolers 
writing programs in arduino C. since then I have taken several courses in diferent languages like HTML, Java Script and most recently C# while learning Unity.
I am making this GIT HUB account now since I feel like I am now at a point where some of my code is actually worth keeping in a repository. I am still very much a beginnr
so I dont think you will find too much of use here yet but with time I immagine I will be able to contribute to the comunity and maybe also help answer somones question or be
the guy with a repository that somone actually uses some day. Anyways dont expect anything too cool just yet.
